#' Check the mixture of data types
#'
#' The function helps to find the columns in a data frame that contains different types of data.
#'  R has 6 atomic vector types. The function roughly identifies if an observation belongs to one of the 3 main data types, number, logical, and character.
#'  Note, the self-defined type "number" here is an assemble of types including numeric (real and decimal), integer and complex.
#'
#' @param df a data frame
#'
#' @return A list of 3 data frames. First one is the input data frame, the second one has the same dimension as the first one, 
#'  but has corresponding data type marked in the cells of the columns where mixture status is found. 
#'  The third data frame is the summary of result, with ID of the columns as row names and the 3 data types as headers.
#'  It tells us the total number of each data type found in each column where mixture is found.

#' Clean the mixture of data types
#'
#' The function helps to delete the observations with unwanted data types in indicated columns in a data frame.
#'
#' @param typemix_result the returned result (a list of 3 data frames) by typemix function.
#' @param column a number or a vector of numbers indicating the ID of columns where you want to apply the function to remove the mixture of data types
#' @param type a data type that you want to keep or delete. The default will be the majority type in the column.
#' @param keep if you want to keep or delete the data type you specify. The default setting is keep=TRUE.
#'
#' @return A data frame with observations in unwanted data types in the columns specified deleted.
#' @export
#' @examples
#' cleanmix(typemix(sample_df),c(1,2),type="number")
#'
#'
cleanmix<-function(typemix_result,column,type=majority,keep=TRUE){
